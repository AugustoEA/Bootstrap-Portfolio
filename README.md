# Bootstrap-Portfolio
Responsiveness Assignment

### Overview

In this assignment, you'll create two different portfolios. The first will be building
your portfolio layout using the Bootstrap CSS Framework. The second will be enhancing
the portfolio you made last unit with a mobile-responsive layout.

### Steps

Using the files provided on the solutions from the previous exercise as a base, I have add a Navbar from Bootstrap, as well as using other content from bootstrap but editted to make it work with my previous Student Bio assignment that I did not finished on the first homework.

Due to a lack of a clear understanding of the Homework instructions, I have also added the responsiveness to this website, making the elements on the screen resize depending with the size of the screen.
